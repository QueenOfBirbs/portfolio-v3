Hi! Thanks for checking out my portfolio and visiting the github. I was originally was going for a retro theme but my brother dared me to use the alligator background and I kinda fell in love with it. Definitely a reflection of my personality and love for tackier items.

I'm no pro yet so there may be some hiccups here and there; mostly with the background not loading when the page opening but shows up if you visit another page and then come back? I'm working on it and will hopefully have a fix for it soon!

Feel to ask any questions or contact me, either through any of the contact methods on the portfolio or through here!
